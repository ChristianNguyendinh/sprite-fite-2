# Sprite Fite 2  
## The Unsuccessful Successor of [Sprite Fight!](https://devpost.com/software/sprite-battle#updates)  
--------------------------------------------------------  
  
Simple card game to practice react/redux. I wasn't satisfied with the last hackathon project I worked on (Sprite Fight!), so I tried to redeem myself by making this. The main goal was to make it multiplayer, which was achieved, but lots of the other things could have gone better. I may pick this back up sometime later, but I think the Sprite Fite franchise is doomed/cursed.  
  
#### Rules:  
1. First player picks 3 cards. Second Player picks 3 cards...  
2. ???  
3. Win  
  
#### --- todo: ---  
  
- favicon   
- LOTS OF STYLE zzz  
- Picking phase turns, diff color for diff player  
- hover for card info  
- sound  
- our redux is disguisting, we can definitely clean it up  
- ***Implement specials (descriptions, death/hp loss animations, spicy stuff)
