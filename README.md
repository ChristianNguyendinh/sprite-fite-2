### TODO:  
--- now: redux ---  
web sockets  
    - have char select highlighting be based on store state - game state too?  
    - web socket multiplayer for the game phase  
  
--- later ---  
- favicon :)  
- was not carful with the array object of cards, so im pretty sure lots of things are sharing the same card object, which explains why in the death function we have 3 deaths and not 2...  
- replace the long import in game rework with an import all as <name> then reference the methods with dot notation
- fix unselecting highlighting 
- fix card playing highlighting  
- organization of files  
- Move inline css to css file
- LOTS OF STYLE zzz

- ***Implement specials (descriptions, death/hp loss animations, spicy stuff)
